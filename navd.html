                <u>What is Big Data? </u>
                <br>
                "Big data" is the massive amount of data available to organizations thatâ€”because of its volume and complexityâ€”is not easily managed or analyzed by many business intelligence tools.
                <br>
                Tools for big data can help with the volume of the data collected, the speed at which that data becomes available to an organization for analysis, and the complexity or varieties of that data.
                <br>
                Start your big data journey with BigQuery, Google Cloudâ€™s data warehouse.

            <h3>Big data overview</h3>
            <p>
                <u>Big data overview</u>
                <br>
                Big data consists of petabytes (more than 1 million gigabytes) and exabytes (more than 1 billion gigabytes), as opposed to the gigabytes common for personal devices.
                <br>
                As big data emerged, so did computing models with the ability to store and manage it. Centralized or distributed computing systems provide access to big data. Centralized computing means the data is stored on a central computer and processed by computing platforms like BigQuery.
                <br>
                Distributed computing means big data is stored and processed on different computers, which communicate over a network. A software framework like Hadoop makes it possible to store the data and run applications to process it.
                <br>
                There are benefits to using centralized computing and analyzing big data where it lives, rather than extracting it for analysis from a distributed system. Insights are accessible to every user in your companyâ€”and integrated into daily workflowsâ€”when big data is housed in one place and analyzed by one platform.

            <h3>Characteristics of big data</h3>
            <p>
    <u>Characteristics of big data</u>
    <br>
    Big data is different from typical data assets because of its volume complexity and need for advanced business intelligence tools to process and analyze it. The attributes that define big data are volume, variety, velocity, and variability. These big data attributes are commonly referred to as the four vâ€™s.
    <br>           
    <u>Volume</u>
    <br>
    The key characteristic of big data is its scaleâ€”the volume of data that is available for collection by your enterprise from a variety of devices and sources.
    <br>
    <u>Variety</u>
    <br>
    Variety refers to the formats that data comes in, such as email messages, audio files, videos, sensor data, and more. Classifications of big data variety include structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.
    <br>       
    <u>Velocity</u>
    <br>
    Big data velocity refers to the speed at which large datasets are acquired, processed, and accessed.
    <br>
    <u>Variability</u>
    <br>
    Big data variability means the meaning of the data constantly changes. Therefore, before big data can be analyzed, the context and meaning of the datasets must be properly understood.
    <br>

            <p>
                <u>Why is big data important?</u>
                <br>
                Data can be a companyâ€™s most valuable asset. Using big data to reveal insights can help understand the areas that affect your businessâ€”from market conditions and customer purchasing behaviors to your business processes. 
                <br>
                These understandings help drive impactful decision-making.
                <br>

            <h3>Examples of big data</h3>
            <p>
                <u>Examples of big data</u>
                <br>
                The varied and high-volume, high-velocity big data your enterprise manages is a vital asset, one that can drive enhanced decision-making for improved business outcomes. Harnessing big data through effective data analytics provides many competitive advantages. Applications of big data include:
                <br>
                <u>Hyper-personalization in retail with big data</u>
                <br>
                Insight from big data can help retail enterprises better understand their customersâ€™ preferences and behaviors. With that understanding, a retailer can hyper-personalize marketing initiatives and shopping experiences that redefine the customer experience.
                <br>
                <u>Streamlining process in finance with big data</u>
                <br>
                Applications of big data can help firms make the most of their financial data to improve operational efficiencies by streamlining the time and processes to actionable insights. This streamlining minimizes bottlenecks and allows more time for identifying new revenue opportunities.
                <br>
                <u>Scaling expansion with big data</u>
                <br>
                There are insights hidden in big data. Those insights help companies enhance performance, boost competitiveness, and effectively adjust the business model for successful expansion into new markets.
            <br>
